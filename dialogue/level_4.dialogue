Sailor Conn: Greetings, human. That crystal tower? It's broken. Its shards are scattered around the moon, but I’m sure you’ll manage to find them.
Sailor Conn: By the way, I’m Sailor Conn, protector of Jupiter. It’s rare to see visitors here.
Sailor Conn: Here's a map by the way. You can press "M" to open it. It could be useful.
- Got it.
do InventoryManager.add_item_to_inventory("map", 1)
Sailor Conn: I think that's basically it. Just find the shards, and you're done.
- Thanks, I'll find them quickly.
	Sailor Conn: If you say so.
- Can you help me?
	Sailor Conn: Sure thing! I can help you find them, when you start looking for them. Good luck!

% ???: Wow, another shard! You might actually finish this… but I wouldn’t get my hopes up.
% ???: Look at you go! I really thought you’d quit by now. Guess I was only half right.
% ???: Another one? Cute. Let’s see if luck carries you all the way.
% ???: You’re persistent, I’ll give you that. Too bad that’s not the same as being good.

???: Do not trust a book by its cover. Your instincts may know better.
Player: I guess that's all the shards. Better go back.

AI: Error: Shard pieces are incomplete.
Sailor Conn: [#emotion=confused] Is something wrong?
Player: It says I'm missing a piece... but I know I have them all.

Sailor Conn: [#emotion=happy] You should double-check. You can never be too sure, right?
- Double-check
	Player: I guess so. I'll re-check the area to see if I missed any.
	Sailor Conn: Sure thing.

Player: Are you sure that the last shard is here?
Sailor Conn: Of course! Why would you doubt me?

Player: Are you hiding something from me, Con?
Sailor Conn: [#emotion=angry] Fine... I do have the last shard.
Sailor Conn: As Jupiter's guardian, I hold deep resentment for Saturn. They say Jupiter was meant to be a star... a second sun. But Saturn’s pull?
Sailor Conn: It held Jupiter back, stopping it from reaching its full potential. Some of us still believe Jupiter deserved better.
Sailor Conn: [#emotion=angry] And you, human… you’re friends with Chloe LouiSZA, aren't you? She's from Saturn. I couldn’t just let you win so easily.
Sailor Conn: [#emotion=sad] I let my anger cloud my duty. I shouldn't have done that. Here... take the shard. Fix the tower and refill your oxygen.
