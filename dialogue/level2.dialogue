~ intro
Franzen Albert II: Your suit’s damaged—specifically the part that shields you from these winds.
Player: Who are you? Why should I trust you?
Franzen Albert II: Name’s Franzen, but back on Earth, they called me Albert II.
	Humans said I died, but they abandoned me when my suit failed—just like yours is now. I survived by adapting. I wouldn’t leave someone to suffer the way I did.
AI: Suit broken. Please fix.
Player: "Thank you."
